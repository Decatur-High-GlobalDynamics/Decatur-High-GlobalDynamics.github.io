# Notes

## leading team motion and vision platforms
- team 900 zebracorn
  - hardware:
    - StereoLabsâ€™ ZED Stereoscopic Camera
    - Custom 3D printed green LED "ring" case enclosure for camera and [Buck Boost Converter](https://www.amazon.com/DROK-Automatic-Converter-Regulator-Adjustable/dp/B00JKG57T4) to eliminate flicker
    - nVidia Jetson TX2 connected via USB
    - NavX-MXP Gyro
  - ROS w/ C++
  - images down sampled by 1/2 from 720p to reduce computational overhead

## image acquisition
- tuning of exposure and brightness to minimum settings to isolate for reflected bright LED light
- use of navx clock for timestamps shared between co-processor and roborio (avoid time sync)
  - zebracorns 2017VisionCode/zebROS ws/src/navx publisher/

## image processing

### target identification

### data calculation

- Coordinate translation between frames of reference
  - robot center x,y,z
  - camera center x,y,z
  - mounting point x,y,z
  - odometry: where robot has moved since last initialized
  - map: track robot's pose with respect to global map
- Translate target location from image based x, y, and calculated depth to real-world values:
  - distance from target
  - sideways (mis)alignment of target in relation to robot
  - vertical (mis)alignment of target in relation to robot
  - angle robot needs to turn for on target heading
  - timestamp point-in-time at which preceding data was accurate for latency compensation

### data transmission
