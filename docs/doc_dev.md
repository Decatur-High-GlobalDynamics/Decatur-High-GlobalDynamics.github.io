Welcome technical documentation developers! Thank you for lowering barriers and making the learning curve a gentler climb. Doc development takes place in the [github pages][github-pages-overview] [documentation repository][team4026-doc-repo] for @Decatur-High-GlobalDynamics.

# Pre-requisites for contributors:
- [development environment](devenv.md)
- understanding of [git basics](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/git-getting-started.html?highlight=testing#git-version-control-introduction)
- understanding of [markdown][markdown-syntax]

# Optional:
- [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll][github-pages-execute-locally]

[Github Guides][github-guides] provides a general overview of: git, github, github pages, forking projects, issues, tracking people and projects, markdown, and documentation. It should take a little less than an hour and a half to read through all of the guides.

# Steps:
- open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you put your github pages repositories
- clone the documentation repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Decatur-High-GlobalDynamics/Decatur-High-GlobalDynamics.github.io.git
```

- open the new repository directory in vs code
