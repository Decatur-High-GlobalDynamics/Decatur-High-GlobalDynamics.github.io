Welcome technical documentation developers! Thank you for lowering barriers and making the learning curve a gentler climb. Doc development takes place in the [github pages][github-pages-overview] [documentation repository][team4026-doc-repo] for @Decatur-High-GlobalDynamics.

Pre-requisites for contributors:
- [development environment](docs/devenv.md)
- understanding of [git basics](/docs/git_basics.md)
- understanding of [markdown][markdown-syntax]
- complete the hello world exercise to demonstrate mastery of the basics (TODO)

Optional:
- enable local testing by installing ruby and jekyll (Guide Needed)

[Github Guides][github-guides] provides a general overview of: git, github, github pages, forking projects, issues, tracking people and projects, markdown, and documentation. It should take a little less than an hour and a half to read through all of the guides.
