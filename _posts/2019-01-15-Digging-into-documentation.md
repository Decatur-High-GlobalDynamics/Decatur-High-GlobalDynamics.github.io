Welcome to our new public documenation website built with github pages, jekyll, and markdown!

If you're on Team 4026 and interested in helping with documentation, check out the [Jekyll Github Pages Documenatation][jekyll-ghpages-docs] and talk to a coder with organizational github repo maintainer rights if you need help with accessing the [Documentation Repository][team4026-doc-repo]. 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
